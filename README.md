# HVCCC Visualisation

Our purpose is to provide a realistic three-dimensional visualisation model of the network
with a high degree of detail and visual fidelity.
This project aims to:
- Provide a three-dimensional visualisation model of the Hunter Valley Rail Network,
- Provide a model that can be used to sell the advantages of the HVCCC and its rail
network to potential customers,
- Give HVCCC and its customers a holistic three-dimensional overview of what is
occurring on the network at any one time,
- Give HVCCC the ability to easily modify and manipulate the network to visualise
various rail topologies.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1. Unity - v2019.2.5f1 
2. Windows Operating System
3. 10GB of Disk Space

### Installing

1. Install Unity (We recommend using Unity Hub then downloading the specified version)
2. Download the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Zijji/HVCCC_Visualisation.git
```
3. Open the project with Unity
4. Load Scene (Need to put the name of the Scene here)
5. Click the play button

## Tests

Our tests can be found in the test document. Refer to "Test Outcomes" document. 

## Requirements

Our requirements and deliverables can be found in the requirements document. Refer to "Software Requirements Specification" document. 

## Coding Style

Where applicable, the HVCCC C# coding standards have been abided by. There are such instances where the Unity game engine makes us use specific coding styles.
Additionally, MapBox uses key coding standards which we had to adapt our code to abide by. This guide can be found in their [API documentation.] (https://docs.mapbox.com/api/)

## Deployment

### Deploying system into an executable
1. Go to ”File”
2. Go to ”Build Settings”
3. Click ”Build"

## Built With
* [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) - Satellite images
