# HVCCC Visualization

Our purpose is to provide a realistic three-dimensional visualisation model of the network
with a high degree of detail and visual fidelity.
This project aims to:
- Provide a three-dimensional visualisation model of the Hunter Valley Rail Network,
- Provide a model that can be used to sell the advantages of the HVCCC and its rail
network to potential customers,
- Give HVCCC and its customers a holistic three-dimensional overview of what is
occurring on the network at any one time,
- Give HVCCC the ability to easily modify and manipulate the network to visualise
various rail topologies.
